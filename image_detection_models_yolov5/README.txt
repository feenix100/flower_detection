These are yolov5 image detection models trained on a dataset with roughly 10,000 photos of cannabis flowers(buds). I trained it for free using google colab. 800 epochs was the right amount for 99% detection rate. Works with images or video.

Use bud800.pt to detect cannabis buds.

leaf1000epoch.pt was my attempt to only detect the leaves on the buds.

The names can be changed without corrupting the file.
